# Enquirer Tours

## Background

In early 2019, construction began on a National Enquirer attraction building located in Pigeon Forge, TN, and Branson, MO. Later renamed to Beyond the Lens, the company was looking for a way to integrate Google Earth into an attraction they could use. Based on a previous prototype for WonderWorks locations:

> Google Earth is a virtual globe and map that gives you the opportunity to travel anywhere you want within a matter of seconds! Explore different countries and continents viewing satellite imagery, terrain, structures, and more.

The attraction would, by default, allow users to start a tour, which would take a pre-defined list of locations to travel to is a KMZ (Google Earth Placemark) file.

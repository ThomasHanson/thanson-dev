# UCF MCLDN (capstone project)

## Background

The J-4 desires continued study of the employment of existing and future logistics vessels, aircraft, and vehicles to sustain disaggregated U.S. Forces during conflict. The Joint Force is considering acquisition of new multi-capable distribution platforms to meet anticipated shortfalls in capacity. All platforms will need to work together to provide a responsive and flexible distribution system to sustain the Joint Force’s new operating concepts.

## Problem Statement

The project is an offline software that can match up an arbitrary military unit’s logistical needs with the means of transporting those goods. Given lists of required supplies, their destinations, and available vehicles, we would like to create an optimal distribution of those supplies on those vehicles, considering payload size, average speed, and range.

Another parameter that needs to be taken into account is the attrition rate, which is the probability each day that the vehicle will experience a critical failure of some kind. Our sponsor has indicated that the probability of attrition is relatively low, around one percent. Initially, the sponsor wants us to focus on one type of vehicle (Semi-Submersible Vessels) and one supply resource (Fuel) and integrate other means of transport and other resources as a stretch goal.

## Senior Design

> Senior Design is a two-semester sequence of courses in which computer science students work in teams of about five on a single project. They use the skills they have learned to solve a realistic and meaningful problem. At UCF, hundreds of computer science students graduate each year after demonstrating their knowledge, skills and readiness in these capstone courses. These real-world project-based learning experiences prepare our graduating students with on-the-job knowledge and skills.

### Course Structure:

#### Senior Design I:
* **Project Pitches**
	* At the beginning of the semester, approved sponsors pitch their projects to students during class through in person or virtual means.
* **Project Selection & Group Formation**
	* After project pitches complete, students rank their top ten projects of their choice. Once the deadline has reached, the CS Senior Design Coordinator completes project selection by forming groups based off the student rankings.
* **Senior Design Bootcamp**
	* In the newly formed groups, students attend Senior Design Bootcamp lead by the CECS Senior Design Coordinators. In Bootcamp, students perform group exercises in which they get to know their teammates, set goals, as well as grow individually as a team player.
* **Sponsor & Faculty Check-in Meetings**
	* Teams will meet weekly with their project sponsor or do a check-in with the Senior Design faculty (TAs or Coordinator). The primary purpose of these meetings is to gather and update requirements for their document and keep the team on track.
* **Final Design Document**
	* Students carry out the design of the project (determining objectives, tasks, task assignment to group members, programming language and technology determination, researching and solving design problems, documenting related and prior work, etc.) This document is comprised of at least 30 pages per team member (120 pages total for our group) and is submitted at end of this semester.

#### Senior Design II:
* **Begin Project Implementation**
	* During the Senior Design II semester, the primary task is project implementation. Students begin implementing the design outlined and planned in their final design document from the previous semester.
* **Critical Design Review**
	* Formal in-class design review presentation is held two months into the second semester, where sponsors are encouraged to attend. Teams are reviewed by each of their peers in the class as well as the CS Senior Design Coordinator.
* **Faculty Demonstration**
	* In preparation for the upcoming Final Presentation, teams will perform a demonstration of their project for the CS Senior Design Coordinator in a formal setting. At this point, the project should be almost fully completed with the exception of final touches. This demo serves as practice presenting the working product.
* **Final Presentation**
	* At the end of the semester, student teams make a final presentation to a faculty panel and their sponsor, and participate in the UCF CECS Senior Design Day. Final project documentation is due and a Web page for the project is launched.

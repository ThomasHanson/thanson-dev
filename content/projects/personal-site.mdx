## Motivation

I created this site as a unified place to showcase all of projects, create an easy point of contact, and post about my journey. This site also gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies in the process and helped solidify those skills in a real-world scenario.

I wanted to create a place that allowed me to fit more than what a 1-page resume would and highlight my skills better. I plan to add further integrations and make this a hub for visualizing/tracking past and current projects.

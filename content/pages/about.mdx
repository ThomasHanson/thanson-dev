title: About

My name is Thomas. I'm a graduate from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

My journey into the world of programming began when I was about 14. With no understanding of programming at the time, I attempted opening entire programs in Notepad to see the source code.

As expected, Notepad displays the series of bytes as illegible text that cannot be displayed. As a result, I picked up a copy of **Java All-in-One For Dummies**.

From there, this led me to starting to develop basic applications, conversion tools, and then developing Minecraft plugins to apply those skills.

I am currently dedicated to learning new technologies and am pursuing a Software Engineering position to land my dream job and grow my career. You can find some of my other projects on my GitHub.

Outside of work, I am very spontaneous and enjoy anything with addrenaline. I enjoy skydiving and powered paragliding most, which I am looking to pursue more.

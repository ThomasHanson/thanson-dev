<p>
    Hi, I’m Thomas—a software engineer with a passion for creating, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, but my programming journey started quite earlier.
</p>

<p>
    I've always been fascinated with how things work, especially when it comes to technology. My introduction to programming began around 14, with no idea or knowledge of even the basics. I began my attempting to open programs in Notepad to view the source code, which, as expected (now), displays an unintelligible mess.

    />
</p>

<p>
    The initial curiosity of the mess is what sparked something in me, and I picked up a copy of the **Java All-in-One For Dummies** book from a local bookstore. This was my first real step into the world of programming, and I have not looked back.

</p>

    From there, this led me to start building new things:
    - Simple conversion tools (temperature, distance, volume, etc.)
    - Graphical user interfaces
    - Minecraft plugins

    All of these were a great way to learn by doing, and helped me solidify my understanding of the fundamentals/concepts. I fell in love with turning ideas into code.
</p>

<p>
    When I am not coding, I can probably be found chasing adrenaline when I can — skydiving, powered paragliding, slingshots, you name it! All of these help push my outside my comfort zone and take on new challenges, both in my personal & work life.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, I truly enjoy tackling complex problems and finding creative, efficient solutions while doing it. I am currently dedicated to learning new technologies and am pursuing a Software Engineering position to land my dream job and grow my career. You can find some of my other projects on my GitHub.

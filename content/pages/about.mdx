    My name is Thomas. I'm a graduate from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

    My journey into the world of programming began when I was about 14. With no understanding of programming at the time, I attempted opening entire programs in Notepad to see the source code.

    As expected, Notepad displays the series of bytes as illegible text that cannot be displayed. As a result of curiosity, I picked up a copy of the programming book: **Java All-in-One For Dummies** at a local bookstore.

    />

    From there, this led me to starting to develop basic applications to apply these skills, such as:
    - Conversion tools (temperature, distance, volume, etc.)
    - Graphical user interfaces
    - Minecraft plugins

    I am currently dedicated to learning new technologies and am pursuing a Software Engineering position to land my dream job and grow my career. You can find some of my other projects on my GitHub.

    Outside of work, I am very spontaneous and enjoy anything with addrenaline. I enjoy skydiving and powered paragliding most, which I am looking to pursue more.
